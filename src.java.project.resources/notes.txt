Now we have to take care of the mining process itself:
Miner should:
1. Take from MemPool list of transaction
2. Verify each of them ? Or CC provider should before it puts them to MeMPool? A: Miner has to veryfi them as it gets a list of transactions but will verify before building the merkle three 
3. generate many hashes and merkleroot
4. append the block to blockChain when done
5. update the mempool
6. update the utxo
7. update the transactionstatus
